# 1. Basic constructions of the language. Operators. Dialog boxes

## 1. 
Using dialog boxes, collect about the user
the following information:
- FULL NAME
- gender
- age
- e-mail
Then display the collected information in the "confirm" dialog box
and ask the user the question - "Is everything right?":

## 2. 
The user enters the tram ticket number (six-digit
number). Determine if ticket is lucky (in this case
the sum of the first three digits must be equal to the sum of the last three
digits).

## 3. 
Game Guess the number. Ask the user to guess a number from
0 to 100 and guess it in the following way: every iteration
loop divide the range of numbers in half, write the result to N
and ask the user "Is your number > N, < N or == N?".
Depending on what the user has specified, reduce
range. Initial range from 0 to 100, halved and
received 50. If the user indicated that his number is > 50, then
change the range to from 51 to 100. And so on until
the user will not select "Your number == N".
